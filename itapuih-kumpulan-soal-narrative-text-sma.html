                        <p><strong>Narrative Text</strong></p><p>In the forest the fastest running animal is the <strong>rabbit</strong>. No one can beat him. The rabbit arrogantly posed a challenge to all forest dwellers to be able to defeat him.</p><p>When none of the other animals dared to accept his challenge, suddenly the turtle, which was known to walk very slowly, said he had accepted the challenge. One forest in unison laughed at him in disbelief. Moreover, the rabbit who was so arrogant underestimated the ability of the turtle.</p><p>On the day of the start of the match the <strong>rabbit </strong>began to show his ability to run very fast at the beginning of the match. The turtle began to walk quietly and slowly, as if ignoring the ability and arrogance of the rabbit.</p><p>The <strong>rabbit </strong>because he felt that he had the upper hand after running a long distance, he walked leisurely, then sat under a tree. The very cool wind apparently lulled the rabbit to sleep.</p><p>Apparently the <strong>turtle </strong>although walking very slowly but he never stopped. Until finally he passed the rabbit who was asleep under a tree.</p><p>Finally the rabbit woke up and chased the turtle, but unfortunately his efforts were in vain, because the turtle had already reached the finish line and became the winner. The rabbit realized his arrogance.</p><p>The <strong>fable </strong>above gives a message to us that high ability if not accompanied by humility will only produce arrogance.

The magician asked him to work together with him. If Aladdin could do, he would get a lot of gold coins and jewellery. The magician asked Aladdin to go inside the cave and find a magical lamp there. He also gave a ring and said, “If you are in any trouble, rub this ring and a genie will come to your rescue!”<br /><br />Aladdin went into the cave. Inside the cave, Aladdin was surprised by what he saw. Every corner was full of gold and treasures. A few minutes later, he found the lamp and quickly returned to the entrance of the cave. Aladdin called out, “Magician, I have found the lamp.” “Excellent,” answered the magician. “Quick, pass it to me!”<br /><br />Aladdin did not trust the magician so he said, “Not so fast Magician. You must help me out of this cave first.”<br /><br />The magician became very angry. When Aladdin was walking to the entrance, the magician pushed a huge rock over the entrance of the cave and left Aladdin and the lamp behind. Aladdin tried to move the rock all by himself, but it was too big and heavy, “Oh no! I am trapped in the cave!” he cried.<br /><br />Suddenly, he remembered the magic ring. He rubbed it with the palm of his hand. To his surprise, a genie appeared before him and in a powerful voice said, “Master, I am the Genie of the ring. How can I help you?”<br /><br />Aladdin was frightened, but he soon found the courage to ask, “Could you please send me back to my house?” In no time at all Aladdin was back home.<br /><br />Aladdin took out the lamp. He wondered what would happen if he rubbed it. As Aladdin was rubbing it, all of a sudden another enormous genie stood before him. The genie of the lamp said, “Master, your wish is my command.” Aladdin was very excited and wished for an enormous palace and bags full of gold.<br /><br />One day, a beautiful princess was passing by Aladdin’s palace.

                        Beauty and the beast<br /><br />
Once
 upon a time as a merchant set off for market, he asked each of his 
three daughters what she would like as a present on his return. The 
first daughter wanted a brocade dress, the second a pearl necklace, but 
the third, whose name was Beauty, the youngest, prettiest and sweetest 
of them all, said to her father:  



 "All I'd like is a rose you've picked specially for me!"   

<br /> When
 the merchant had finished his business, he set off for home. However, a
 sudden storm blew up, and his horse could hardly make headway in the 
howling gale. Cold and weary, the merchant had lost all hope of reaching
 an inn when he suddenly noticed a bright light shining in the middle of
 a wood. As he drew near, he saw that it was a castle, bathed in light.   

"I hope I'll find shelter there for the night," he said to himself. 

<br /> When
 he reached the door, he saw it was open, but though he shouted, nobody 
came to greet him. Plucking up courage, he went inside, still calling 
out to attract attention. On a table in the main hall, a splendid dinner
 lay already served. The merchant lingered, still shouting for the owner
 of the castle. But no one came, and so the starving merchant sat down to a hearty meal.  <br />
Overcome
 by curiosity, he ventured upstairs, where the corridor led into 
magnificent rooms and halls. A fire crackled in the first room and a 
soft bed looked very inviting. It was now late, and the merchant could 
not resist. He lay down on the bed and fell fast asleep. 

<br /> When he woke next morning, an unknown hand had placed a mug of steaming coffee and some fruit by his bedside.  The
 merchant had breakfast and after tidying himself up, went downstairs to
 thank his generous host. But, as on the evening before, there was 
nobody in sight. Shaking his head in wonder at the strangeness of it 
all, he went towards the garden where he had left his horse, tethered to
 a tree.<br />soal:1. who is the antagonist act on the story?2. how can the beast return to a handsome person?<br /><br /><br />

                        The Ugly Duckling<br /><br />A long time ago on an old farm, lived a duck family. One day, Mother Duck had been sitting on a clutch of a new eggs. One nice morning, the eggs hatched and six beautiful yellow duckling popped out. But one egg was bigger than the rest, and it did not hatch. Mother Duck was suprised. How did it get there? ‘Tock! Tock!’ The duckling in that egg was pecking inside his shell.<br /><br />‘Did I count the eggs wrongly?’ Mother Duck wondered. Before the Mother Duck had time to think about it, the last egg hatched. A strange looking duckling with grey feathers worried Mother Duck. The ducklings grew quickly, but Mother Duck has a secret worry.<br /><br />‘I can’t understand how this ugly duckling can be one of mine?’ she said to herself, shaking her head. Well, the grey dukling certainly was not pretty. He ate far more than his brothers, so that he was outgrowing the other ducklings. By the time passed by, the poor ugly duckling felt more and more unhappy. His brothers did not want to play with him. He was so clumsy, and all the farmyard animals laughed at him because he is ugly. He felt sad and lonely, while Mother Duck did her best to cheer up him.<br /><br />Then one day, the ugly duckling ran away from the farmyard. He began to question all the other birds. ‘Do you know of any ducklings with grey feathers like mine?’ But everyone shook their heads in scorn.<br /><br />‘We don’t know anyone as ugly as you,’ they said.<br /><br />The ugly duckling did not lose heart, however, and kept on asking everyone he met. Then one day, his travels took him near an old countrywoman’s cottage. The old woman caught the ugly duckling because she was thinking he was a stray goose.<br /><br />‘I’ll put this in a hutch. I hope it’s female and lays plenty of eggs!’ said the old woman, whose eyesight was poor. The ugly duckling, however, did not lay a single egg. Then hen kept frightening him. She said that the woman would cook him if he could not lay egg. The duckling was frightened.<br /><br />Then one night, the ugly duckling found the hutch door ajar, so he escaped. Once again he was all alone. He fled as far away as he could, and at dawn, he found himself in a thick bed of reeds. One day at sunrise, he saw some beautiful birds flew above him. They were white, with long slender necks, yellow beaks and large wings. They were flying south to find food and new nests.<br /><br />‘If only I could look like them, just for a day!’ said the duckling, admiringly. Finally winter came. The weather became cold and the water was frozen. The poor duckling left home to seek food in the snow. He was exhausted and dropped to the ground. Luckily, a farmer found him and put him in his big jacket pocket. The farmer and his children look after him well.<br /><br />However, by springtime, he had grown so big that the farmer decided. ‘I’ll set him free by the pond!’ That was when the duckling saw himself mirrored in the water.<br /><br />‘Goodness! How I have changed! I hardly recognize myself!’ He was surprised because he became a beautiful duckling.<br /><br />The flight of swans flew north again and glided on to the pond. The duckling realized he was one of their kind when he saw them, and soon made friends.<br /><br />‘We’re swans like you!’ they said, warmly. ‘Where have you been hiding?’<br /><br />‘It’s a long story,’ the young swan replied, still astounded. Now, he swam majestically with his fellow swans. One day, he heard children on the river bank exclaim: ‘Look at that young swan! He is the finestof them all!’<br /><br /><br />Question:<br /><br />1.How was the duckling like when he came out of the last egg?<br />2.Did the duckling’s brother behave well towards him?<br />3.Why did the ugly duckling leave from the farmyard?<br />4.Who caught the duckling after he had left the farmyard?<br />5.What did the hen do when the duckling couldn’t lay egg?<br />6.Who took care of the duckling well?<br />7.Who was actually the young swan?<br />8.Can you mention the characters in the story?<br /><br /><br />Kunci Jawaban:<br /><br />1.He had grey feathers.

Last week I took my five-year old son, Willy, to a musical
instrument store in my hometown. I wanted to buy him a set of junior drum
because his drum teacher advised me to buy him one. Willy likes listening to
music very much. He also likes asking me everything he wants to know. Even his
questions sometimes seem precocious for a boy of his age. He is very
inquisitive.

<br />

We went there by car. On the way, we saw a policeman
standing near a traffic light regulating the passing cars and other vehicles.
He blew his whistle now and then.

Once upon a time there was a girl name Cindrella. She
lived with her bad step-mother and two step-sisters. She had to do all the
household chores.

One day the king invited all the ladies in the kingdom
to go to a ball (pesta dansa)  in the palace. He wanted to find the Crown
Prince a wife.

The step sisters went to the ball that night with
their mother. Cindrella was left alone. She cried because she actually wanted
to go to the ball, too.

Just then a fairy godmother came. With her magic wand,
she gave Cindrella a coach (kereta),
two horses and footmen. She also gave Cindrella a lovely dress to wear the ball
and a pair of glass slippers. She told Cindrella to come home before midnight.

At the ball, Cindrella danced all night with the
Prince. The Prince fell in love with her. At midnight, Cindrella ran home.
Unfortunately, one of her slippers slipped off at the door. She did not have
time to put it back on. The Prince was sad as he could not find Cindrella again
that night.

The next day, the Prince and his men brought along the
glass slipper. They went all over the Kingdom to search for the owner.

After searching for along time, finally, they came to
Cindrella’s house. The slipper fit her. The prince was very happy to find
Cindrella again. They got married and lived ever after.
